<h1>Newest Information</h1>

<h1>Some admin tips and how-tos</h1>
<h2>How to change the look of the site</h2>
<p>
  There are several ways to change the look of the site depending on how much 
  you want to change.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Changing Elements on the Page</b>
</p>

<p>
  Use the 'Manage Site' menu item to change the look and feel of the site.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adding custom files</b>
</p>
<p>
  You create custom HTML pages by authoring <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=well-formed+xhtml"><b>well-formed XHTML</b></a> files and putting 
  them in the <b>viewfile</b> directory.
</p>
<p>
  To view the files you can browse to 
</p>
<p>
  ${home-url}viewfile/<i>your_file_name.xml</i>
</p>
<p>
  You can use the last part: viewfile/<i>your_file_name.xml</i> as menu and navigation 
  URL actions.
</p>
<p>
  HINT: These files are parsed as <a href="http://phptal.motion-twin.com/manual/php4/index.html"><b>PHPTAL</b></a> files which can include php calls into 
  the runtime system when rendering. 
</p>
<p>
  Many features of ccMixter are implemented with PHPTAL enhanced xml files.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Creating a Skin</b>
</p>
<p>
  Currently there is no interactive way to change styles on the site. If you are familiar
  with XHTML, CSS and basic programming principles you can <a href="${home-url}admin/skin/create">create a new skeleton skin</a> use that as a basis. The most current 
  instructions for how to create a skin can be found at the <a 
  href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost_Skins">ccHost Developer's Wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Creating a Virtual Site</b>
</p>
<p>
  ccHost can create 'virtual' installations without modifying your
  server installation. Read more about this feature <a href="${home-url}viewfile/howtovirtual.xml">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Editing Navigator Tab Sets</h2>
</p>
<div>
  <ul class="cc_tab_edit_help">
     <li><b>Name</b> 
       This is used in the url. For example: if the tab set is called 'mytabs' and the tab name is 'funky' you can browse to the page and highlight that tab by using <code>${home-url}view/mytabs/<i>funky</i></code>
     </li>
    <li><b>Order</b> The order (from left to right) in which the tabs will appear.</li>
    <li><b>Text</b> This is the text that is used in the tab itself.</li>
    <li><b>Help Hint</b> The text that displays when the user hovers over an unselected tab.</li>
    <li><b>Access</b> This is where (like the menus) you decide who gets to see the items. <i>Contests 
          are a special case</i> that hide certain tabs if they are not relevant, so even if you 
          say the 'Submit Entry' tab is available to 'Everyone', it will be hidden if the contest
          date has ended.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Function and Data fields work together to determin what happens when the user
    clicks on the tab. </p>
  <table>
  <tr><th>If 'Function' is set to...:</th><th>Then 'Data' should be...</th></tr>
  <tr><td class='tb'>Match Any Tags</td><td>A comma separated list of tags. The user will see a listing of 
           uploads that have <i>any</i> of the tags specified.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='tb'>Match All Tags</td><td>A comma separated list of tags. The user will see a listing of 
           uploads that have <i>all</i> of the tags specified.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='tb'>Execute URL</td><td>A url to execute. If the url does <i>not</i> start with 'http://' then
    system will assume it is an internal ccHost URL (e.g. 'viewfile/myhelp.xml' or 'files/submit'). If it does start with 'http://' then the user's browser will be redirected to that web address.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='tb'>Subtabs</td><td>The name of a subnaviation tab set that will appear on the screen <i>under</i> the current tab set. (As of 3/2006 only the top tab set can have a sub-tab set).</td></tr>
