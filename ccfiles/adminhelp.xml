<h1>Some admin tips and how-tos</h1>
<h2>How to change the look of the site</h2><p>
There are several ways to change the look of the site depending on how much 
you want to change.
</p><p>
<b>Creating a Virtual Site</b>
</p><p>

ccHost can create 'virtual' installations without modifying your
server installation. Read more about this feature <a href="${home-url}viewfile/howtovirtual.xml">here</a>.
</p><p>

<b>Changing Elements on the Page</b>
</p><p>

Use the 'Manage Site' menu item to change the look and feel of the site.
</p><p>

<b>Adding custom files</b>
</p><p>

You create custom HTML pages by authoring <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=well-formed+xhtml"><b>well-formed XHTML</b></a> files and putting 
them in the <b>ccfiles</b> directory.
</p><p>

To view the files you can browse to 
</p><p>

${home-url}viewfile/<i>your_file_name.xml</i>
</p><p>

You can use the last part: viewfile/<i>your_file_name.xml</i> as menu and navigation 
URL actions.
</p><p>

HINT: These files are parsed as <a href="http://phptal.motion-twin.com/manual/php4/index.html"><b>PHPTAL</b></a> files which can include php calls into 
the runtime system when rendering. 
</p><p>

Many features of ccMixter are implemented with PHPTAL enhanced xml files.
</p><p>

<b>Creating a Skin</b>
</p><p>

Currently there is no interactive way to change styles on the site. 
</p><p>

To customize the look (fonts, colors, element placement, background 
images, etc.) you should make a new skin and edit the .CSS file.
</p><p>

To customize which elements are on the screen and how they interact 
with the user a working knowledge of <a href="http://phptal.motion-twin.com/manual/php4/index.html"><b>PHPTAL</b></a> is required.
</p><p>

To create a skin you need three files. They must all start with the 
prefix 'skin-' and live in the <b>cctemplates</b> directory.
</p>

<ul>
<li>skin-<i>skin_name</i>.css</li>
<li>skin-<i>skin_name</i>.xml</li>
<li>skin-<i>skin_name</i>-map.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the skin called <b>simple</b> for a comprehensive look at what 
a skin can look like.
</p><p>

HINT: Skins can share many (most, all) PHPTAL macros by re-using
macros references in the "map" file. This file tells the page
rendering engine where to find instances of macros being called 
for.
</p><p>
HINT: It is <i>highly</i> recommended that your <i>map</i> be a simple include
of the blank-map:
</p><p>
<code>&lt;phptal:block include="string:skin-blank-map.xml" /&gt;</code>

<h2>Editing Navigator Tab Sets</h2>
<div>
  <ul class="cc_tab_edit_help">
     <li><b>Name</b> 
       This is used in the url. For example: if the tab set is called 'mytabs' and the tab name is 'funky' you can browse to the page and highlight that tab by using <code>${home-url}view/mytabs/<i>funky</i></code>
     </li>
    <li><b>Text</b> This is the text that is used in the tab itself.</li>
    <li><b>Help Hint</b> The text that displays when the user hovers over an unselected tab.</li>
    <li><b>Function</b> 
      Use this to determine what happens when the user clicks on the tab. You can chose to <ul><li>list out upload   based on tags</li>
     <li>specify a URL to fetch a form or file</li></ul> </li>
     <!-- li><b>Limit</b> If you chose an upload listing check this box to limit the searches to the local <a href="$home-url">virtual root</a>. If you chose to execute a URL then this has no effect. </li -->
    <li><b>Data</b> This fields doubles as <i>either</i>
      <ul>
        <li>A comma separated list of tags to search the uploads database when the use selects the tab.</li>
        <li>An internal ccHost URL (e.g. 'viewfile/myhelp.xml' or 'files/submit'). If the URL starts with 'http://' then the next option kicks in:</li>
        <li>An fully qualified path to any place on the web. This can be helpful if you want tabs that point to other virtual roots in your system.</li>
      </ul>
      The interpretation depends the 'Function' field.
    </li>
  </ul>
