About ccHost

The goal of this project is to spread media content that is licensed under 
Creative Commons throughout the web in much the same way that weblogs spread 
CC licensed text. ccHost is web-based infrastructure that may be used to host 
and allow for commenting, remixing, and distribution globally. The more 
installations of ccHost and its variations, the more content there will be 
available for enjoyment and artistic re-use in a sane and legal setting. ccHost
is what is used for the infamous Creative Commons CC Mixter project which 
supports legal media sharing and remixing. For more information, contact Jon 
Phillips at jon@creativecommons.org.
