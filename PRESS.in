Creative Commons Releases Open Source Software ccHost PROJECT_VERSION

San Francisco, USA, April 3, 2006

ccHost, an Open Source project that provides web-based infrastructure  
to support collaboration, sharing, and storage of multi-media using  
Creative Commons licenses and metadata, released version PROJECT_VERSION today.  
These features most notably show up and are tested in Creative  
Commons' project, ccMixter (http://www.ccmixter.org), a popular on- 
line music social network service that supports legal media sharing  
and remixing. ccHost is the Open Source Software engine powering  
ccMixter. Anyone may download, install, and use ccHost to freely  
build media sharing communities.

About ccHost

The goal of this project is to spread media content that is licensed  
under Creative Commons throughout the web in much the same way that  
weblogs spread CC licensed text. ccHost is web-based infrastructure  
that may be used to host and allow for commenting, remixing, and  
distribution globally. The more installations of ccHost and its  
variations, the more content there will be available for enjoyment  
and artistic re-use in a sane and legal setting. ccHost is what is  
used for the infamous Creative Commons ccMixter project, which  
supports legal media sharing and remixing.

About Creative Commons

Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization  
that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works  
- whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licenses  
provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon  
the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a  
voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. Creative Commons is  
sustained by the generous support of various foundations including  
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Omidyar  
Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation,
