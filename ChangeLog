	current build so we can start having thrice-daily builds of the
	package available on mirrors. Also added option:
	make snapshots to make snapshots into the packages folder which is
	set by the MAX_SNAPSHOTS var in the makefile. Also, added a 
	basic ability to sign packages which is useful for releases. I just
	wanted to automate this a little bit more.

	* mixter-lib/cc-phpbb2.php mixter-lib/cc-phpbb2-cb.php: Moved the 
	phpbb code here from the old location in cclib.

2006-04-03  Jon Phillips  <jon@creativecommons.org>

	* Makefile Makefile.dist: Now more intelligently handle make install
	to check if we have an installation at $(DESTDIR)$(WEBDIR) to not
	erase everything. Also, makes backups if cchost already exists so that
	one can keep their settings files, etc. User data loss is the worst 
	thing EVER! Also, this fixes a problem when doing install where you
	keep overwriting and adding to an already crufty install, or things 
	one has already added.

	* VERSION cclib/cc-defines.php: Open for business once more on 2.1-SVN

	broken, could not create a new contest

	* Beta 0.2.0 Release
	* Error on new registration
	* Editorial picks and ratings gets and shows the wrong records
	* Avatars were blowing up when there were errors in the form
	* Fixed bad listings when 'Latest Remixes' were visible
	* Most new 'features' were actually for enabling ccMixter specific 
	scenarios between international Creative Commons installations, 
	hence the 0.2 bump. As of today the RESTful sample pool API in 
	this release is considered 'undocumented' and therefore should be 
	ignored by non-Creative Commons clients until further notice (i.e. 
	after it works).

	* System was demanding a cookie domain for several installations 
	'null' was the right choice
	* Added API for developers to check for and add permanant menu 
	items on the fly
	* Checking for writable phptal_cache directory when template 
	generation fails
	* Patches for 0.1.0 installation are included in this release in 
	ccextras/cc-update.php which will be picked up the first time you 
	run the new installation.
