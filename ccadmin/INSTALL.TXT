Installation notes for ccHost 3.0
=================================

Please check the project website/wiki to see if there are updates to any of 
these steps: http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost#Install


Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0
-------------------------

This specific upgrade requires a few extra steps:

    1. Make a BACKUP of your MySQL database (can be done via phpMyAdmin or from
       the command line using mysqldump)

    2. Make a BACKUP of your cchost directory onto your local machine (skip the
       /people and /contests directories). If you skip this step and you made 
       changes (to say ccfiles/home.xml) then ALL YOUR CHANGES WILL BE LOST 
       FOREVER

    3. Login to ccHost as your admin account and make sure to check 
       'Remember me'
    4. Unzip the cchost 3.0 package on your local machine

    5. Copy everything under the cchost directory EXCEPT ccadmin over your 
       server's ccHost directory

    6. Delete the file ccextras/cc-language.php

    7. Delete ALL files under cclib/phptal/phptal_cache

    8. If you made changes to files in ccfiles (like home.xml), copy your 
       local version over the ones on your server now.

    9. Browse to: http://where_you_installed/?update=1 


New Install (Simple or Hosted Environment)
------------------------------------------

If you are using a shared server or other hosted site (like Dreamcast, etc.) 
then your hosting service probably provided you with a web interface for 
creating a database, doing file uploads and setting permissions for files and 
directories. You will need to create a new database for ccHost BEFORE running 
this installation:

    1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP archive on your local system and copy the files to 
       your server retaining the the directory structure.

    2. Browse to http://where_you_installed/ccadmin and follow all the 
       instructions from then on.

New Install (Advanced)
----------------------

If you have basic knowledge of using FTP and you are comfortable
at a UNIX command line you can use these steps to intall: 

    1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP, tar.gz, or tar.bz2 archive on your local system 
       and copy the files (retaining the directory structure) to your web 
       server.

       For example:

       cp -a cchost-1.0.3 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost
       chgrp -R apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost
       chmod g+w /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/
       chmod -R g+w /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/cclib/phptal/phptal_cache/

   2. Install getID3.  Unpack the package, and then copy the getid3 directory 
      to the location it will be accessed.  For example:

      tar xzf getid3.tar.gz
      cp -a getid3/getid3 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/

   3. Create a database instance and users to access it.  For example:

      mysql -p -u root

      mysql> CREATE DATABASE cchost;
      mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE ON cchost.* 
      ->     TO 'cchost'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

      Make sure to change 'password' (and maybe cchost) to something
      unique to your site.

   4. Create directory /var/log/cchost or other location to store log files.  
      Must be writable by apache.  For example:

      mkdir /var/log/cchost
      chown apache:apache /var/log/cchost

   5. Browse to http://where_you_installed_cchost/ccadmin 

   6. Follow the instructions from there on...
