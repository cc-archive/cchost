|  Installation notes for 1.0.2 (Stable) |
=========================================


 UPGRADE EXISTING ccHOST INSTALLATIONS
---------------------------------------

For 1.0.RC installations:

Copy this installation over your current installation. It 
is not necessary to run the installer.

For everybody before that (beta testers):

A full reinstall in needed. All configuration and 
customations will be lost.


 NEW INSTALL: (no phpBB2 integration)
------------------------------------------------
If you have basic knowledge of using FTP you can use these steps to 
quickly get started. 

 1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP archive on your local system and
    copy the files (retaining the directory sturcture)
    to you web server.

 2. Browse to http://where_you_installed_cchost/ccadmin 

 3. Follow the instructions from there on...

UNIX Installations Take Note: on the last screen of the 
installation process you'll be prompted to read about
specific issues regarding file permissions. DO NOT 
SKIP THIS STEP!!!!


 NEW INSTALL: (with phpBB2 integration)
------------------------------------------------

  1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP archive on your local system and
     copy the files (retaining the directory sturcture)
     to you web server.

  2. Download and install phpBB:
     http://www.phpbb.com/downloads.php

  2. Create a "Reviews" forum. MAKE NOTE of the 
     forum ID number in the Administrators panel.

 3. Unzip the cchost-phpBB-template ZIP archive
    in cctools directory to your local system -- 
    this should create a 'cchost' directory.

 4. Copy that 'cchost' directory into your phpBB2/templates 
    directory at the same level as 'subSilver'

 5. NOTE: If you installed ccHost into the root directory of your 
    server you can SKIP this step. 

      In the file phpBB2\templates\cchost\cchost.cfg

         $cc_host_root = '/';

      Replace the backslash '/' with your ccHost directory
      (as seen in the BROWSER relative to your domain name):

	 $cc_host_root = '/cchost_dir/';

 6. In the phpBB2 Administration panel, under 
    'Styles Admin' select 'Add'

 7. Click ' install' next to 'cchost'

 8. Under 'General Admin' select 'Configuation'

 9. Select 'cchost' for the 'Default Style' and select 'override users 
    style' then click 'Submit'
     (Don't freak when your screen loses all styles.)

 10. Log out of phpBB2

 11. Browse to http://where_you_installed_cchost/ccadmin 

 12. Follow the instructions from there on...
