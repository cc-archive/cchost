|  Installation notes for v2.0.0 RC     |
=========================================


UPGRADE EXISTING ccHOST INSTALLATIONS
-------------------------------------

  1. Log in as administrator

  2. Copy this installation over your current 
     installation. 

  3. Browse to: http://where_you_installed/?update=1


NEW INSTALL (Simple or Hosted Environment): 
-------------------------------------------
If you are using a shared server or other hosted site 
(like Dreamcast, etc.) then your hosting service
probably provided you with a web interface for 
creating a database, doing file uploads and setting
permissions for files and directories. You will need 
to create a new database for ccHost BEFORE 
running this installation:

 1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP archive on your local system
    and copy the files to your server retaining the
    the directory structure.

 2. Browse to http://where_you_installed/ccadmin and
    follow all the instructions from then on.

NEW INSTALL (Advanced): 
-----------------------
If you have basic knowledge of using FTP and you are comfortable
at a UNIX command line you can use these steps to intall: 

 1. Unzip the ccHost ZIP or tar.bz2 archive on your local system and
    copy the files (retaining the directory structure)
    to your web server.

    For example:
    cp -a cchost-1.0.3 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost
    chgrp -R apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost
    chmod g+w /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/
    chmod -R g+w /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/cclib/phptal/phptal_cache/

 2. Install getID3.  Unpack the package, and then copy the getid3
    directory to the location it will be accessed.  For example:

    tar xzf getid3.tar.gz
    cp -a getid3/getid3 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cchost/

 3. Create a database instance and users to access it.  For example:

    mysql -p -u root

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE cchost;
    mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE ON cchost.* 
    ->     TO 'cchost'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

    Make sure to change 'password' (and maybe cchost) to something
    unique to your site.

 4. Create directory /var/log/cchost or other location to store log
    files.  Must be writable by apache.  For example:

    mkdir /var/log/cchost
    chown apache:apache /var/log/cchost

 5. Browse to http://where_you_installed_cchost/ccadmin 

 6. Follow the instructions from there on...
