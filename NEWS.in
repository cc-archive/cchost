New Features in 4.0
======================

- Playlists/Favorites

  audio in it, all items will be treated like a playlist.

- Embedded MP3 player

  Audio uploads can now be played directly in the browser with a customized
  embedded MP3 player.

- Remix Radio Channels

  A 'remix radio' with configurable streaming channels allows users to 
  decide what they want to hear and how.

- "Publicize" Users

  Anyone can include a list of links (or audio player) on their blogs or 
  other websites by cutting and pasting customized code for any artist
  on the site.

- Query Engine

  A very powerful query engine now sits at the heart of most of the
  ccHost installation. There are dozens of parameters to control the
  output which can be formatted as feeds, playlists, plain text or
  dozens of specialized HTML formats. The engine is avaiable
  from URLs in the browser, Navigators Tabs, templates and (of 
  course) directly from plug-in code.

- 'Run Once' Pages

  Admins can configure several 'run once' pages that their registered
  users will see once and then never again. Perfect for 'Welcome' 
  screen or pledge drives.

- Default User Avatar
 
  Admins can set a specific default user avatar for new users.

- New 'Super-Admin' Group

  A group of users can be added as 'super-admin' and each URL in the system
  can be assigned to any level of user.

- Added new Creative Commons 3.0 licenses

  The newly released Creative Commons 3.0 licenses are available from the 
  virtual root licenses selector. You must select these manually for the
  time being.


Improvements in 4.0
====================

- Performance Boost

  The entire page loading mechanism has been revamped. While remaining
  backwards ccmpatible with previous installations page response times
  have improved by as much as 2-4 times 3.1. (Sites with custom code
  will have some minor adjustments to make.)

- New License Merging 

  Remixing a new work from different licensed material is now up to
  CC spec.

- Auto-approve Sample Pools

  Admins now longer have to manually approve remote remixes as they come
  in from 'trusted' remote pools.

- Reviews/Ratings Changes

  Ratings can now be dependant on reviews and a new ranking system based
  on favorites and (for audio) embedded plays along with user ratings.

- International Encoding

  Universal encoding is now enforced throughout the site

- Forums Improvments/Features

  Individual topics can be translated by your internations community. Threads
  can be locked and branches can be deleted.

- AJAX Everywhere

  ccHost has standardized on prototype.js and (pieces of) the Rico library
  for the browser and Zend's JSON encoder on the server to created performant, 
  highly interactive user interface.

- New Language Editor

  Now translators and admins have an easy to use string editor to create 
  internation tranlations and domain specific installations without touching
  the code.

- Feeds, Streaming, Playlists and Sample Pool use New Query Engine

  All feeds and Sample Pool searches are now using the query engine with
  means you can now add parameters to do things like offset paging 
  and dozens of other features.
