ccHost Release Notes
====================

Version: PROJECT_VERSION

This is a simple bugfix release to counter several critical bugs found after 
releasing ccHost PROJECT_VERSION. Primarily, one could not create a contest 
and there were some other problems with the sample-pool api.

Features
========

	* Makefile Makefile.dist: Made more robust and now backup cchost 
	installations done with 'make install'. Also added a 
	'make uninstall-all' which removes all cchos installations at 
	default web directory location.

Bugfixes
========

	* cclib/cc-uploadapi.php: bugfix: upload broken if 'people' didn't 
	already exist

	* cclib/cc-ratings-admin.inc: mysql5 choked on ratings 
	query

	* cclib/cc-admin.php: non-root installs were too easy to 
	screw up (take2), we were generating misleading info about rewrite

	* cclib/cc-contest-admin.inc cclib/cc-contest.php: SubmitSource was 
	broken, could not create a new contest

	* ccadmin/index.php: non-root installs were too easy to 
	screw up

	* cclib/cc-pools.php: sample-ui switch was overriding 
	install

	* cclib/cc-uploadapi.php: upload was broken on 
	sharedhosts (e.g. dreamhost) (now with Id)
