ccHost Release Notes
====================

Version: 3.1

This release is an 'admin' release with only a few feature. It is 
geared toward addressing the needs specifically called out with the 
3.0 release.

New features (user)
========================

Show Last Updated Date
-----------------------
ccHost is now tracking the last time a major change
was made to an upload (files added, deleted, etc.)
and displays it along with the operation on the 
upload's main page.

'What I Look For/Pound On' Browser
-----------------------------------
These two user profile fields are now cross referenced
in a new browser. Click on a 'looking for' link in a 
user's profile and you this:

http://ccmixter.org/media/search/people/lookinfor/acid#acid

Alpha-Browser of Users
-----------------------
The generic 'people' page now allows for browsing by
first letter of name. Example here:

http://ccmixter.org/media/people?p=n


New features (admin)
========================

Paths Admin
-------------------
As of this release, all paths used by ccHost can be specified
by admin including templates, caches, plugins, etc. This is
the last update that requires customization be done within
the ccHost tree and the last update admins will be required
to move their customization files 'out of the way' when doing
an update.

Major Sample Pool Improvements
------------------------------
Sample pools has been greatly optimized (several
times faster for display) and users can now browse by
artists' first initial. Example is here:

http://ccmixter.org/freesound/pools/pool/4/n


Site Disabling
---------------
Admins can temporarily disable the site in a 'friendly' way
that doesn't look like the site is broken. 


eMail Notifications on Moderation
---------------------------------
Admins can decide whether to automatically notify via email owners
of recently moderated (banned) uploads and specify the message to
be sent.


New eMail Rules Engine
-----------------------
Admins can configure who can mail how often based on several criteria
including who they are mailing to. This is an attempt to strike a 
balance between spamming and legitamate contact between community
members.


Experimental: Psuedo-Verification of Uploads
--------------------------------------------
For file formats unknown to getID3, admins can now specify a 
'fall-back' handler built into ccHost that will try to identify
the file via the signature at the beginning of the file. This
allows for a much wider (if less secure) variety of files not
supported before (e.g. plain text, auto-cad, pdf, etc.) This
feature is experimental and potentially (if not likely) a 
source of virus and trojan distribution if not used very
carefully.
