<h1>Some admin tips and how-tos</h1>
<h2>How to change the look of the site</h2><p>
There are several ways to change the look of the site depending on how much 
you want to change.
</p><p>
<b>Creating a Virtual Site</b>
</p><p>

ccHost can create 'virtual' installations without modifying your
server installation. Read more about this feature <a href="${home-url}viewfile/howtovirtual.xml">here</a>.
</p><p>

<b>Changing Elements on the Page</b>
</p><p>

Use the 'Manage Site' menu item to change the look and feel of the site.
</p><p>

<b>Adding custom files</b>
</p><p>

You create custom HTML pages by authoring <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=well-formed+xhtml"><b>well-formed XHTML</b></a> files and putting 
them in the <b>ccfiles</b> directory.
</p><p>

To view the files you can browse to 
</p><p>

${home-url}viewfile/<i>your_file_name.xml</i>
</p><p>

You can use the last part: viewfile/<i>your_file_name.xml</i> as menu and navigation 
URL actions.
</p><p>

HINT: These files are parsed as <a href="http://phptal.motion-twin.com/manual/php4/index.html"><b>PHPTAL</b></a> files which can include php calls into 
the runtime system when rendering. 
</p><p>

Many 'features' of ccMixter are implemented with PHPTAL enhanced xml files.
</p><p>

<b>Creating a Skin</b>
</p><p>

Currently there is no interactive way to change styles on the site. 
</p><p>

To customize the look (fonts, colors, element placement, background 
images, etc.) you should make a new skin and edit the .CSS file.
</p><p>

To customize which elements are on the screen and how they interact 
with the user a working knowledge of <a href="http://phptal.motion-twin.com/manual/php4/index.html"><b>PHPTAL</b></a> is required.
</p><p>

To create a skin you need three files. They must all start with the 
prefix 'skin-' and live in the <b>cctemplates</b> directory.
</p>

<ul>
<li>skin-<b>skin_name</b>.css</li>
<li>skin-<b>skin_name</b>.xml</li>
<li>skin-<b>skin_name</b>-map.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the skin called <b>simple</b> for a comprehensive look at what 
a skin can look like.
</p><p>

HINT: Skins can share many (most, all) PHPTAL macros by re-using
macros references in the "map" file. This file tells the page
rendering engine where to find instances of macros being called 
for.
