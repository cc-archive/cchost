	* README README.TXT: Renamed README.TXT to README.

	* bin/README bin/fix_permission.sh: Added script for fixing
	permissions and generally made a place for not web-based scripts.

	* bin/backup_configs.sh: Backup the config files so that we don't 
	erase our setup when we do CVS up.
	
	* bin/fix_live_setup.sh: Fix our setup so that it will work live. This
	includes moving ccadmin to a backed up position as well as moving any 
	backud up config files to their standard positions.
	
	* bin/restore_configs.sh: If there are backed up files, then they are
	placed in their standard positions as in CVS.

	* PRESS.in: Press Release file to be included along with the release.

	* README ccadmin/INSTALL.txt: Updated README file and also 
	ccadmin/INSTALL.txt with the newest instructions (which aren't that 
	much different).

	* ccHost-phpBB2-template.zip: Added this package to the mix. Yes, it 
	changes, but is necessary in order to do forum integration. I 
	decided it important to include.


2005-10-18  Victor Stone  <fourstones@users.sf.net>

	* ccextras/cc-import-files.php: simple way to admin's to import files
	already on a server into the system (useful for very large files that 
	were ftp'd to the server outside of the cchost system)
	* cclib/cc-submit.php: 'enable' flag was not being honored on
	submit forms

	* *: new submit forms were not showing up in throttle rules, not all 
	verify errors were being caught when file had no extension, download 
	button didn't work in review topic header, topic count was out of sync 
	when topic was deleted, check for and display forum feed button, new 
	submit forms were not showing up in throttle rules, put site into 
	email subject when generating email for whitelisting, forgot next/prev 
	button for activity log, download popup menu was drifting down on every
	click in IE

	* Makefile Makefile.dist: Packaging nearly complete to make releases
	easier.

2005-10-09  Jon Phillips  <jon@creativecommons.org>

	* favicon.ico: Moved into ccimages per legal review of the site.

	* cc-install-db.php: Changed some initial install values for the
	footer and header to be legally compliant.

	* VERSION: Added version number file.

	* COPYING LICENSE.TXT: Deleted LICENSE.TXT and moved to COPYING, a
	standard location.

	* Makefile Makefile.dist: Added Makefiles to help with building the
	release packages and adjusting other parts of the release process.
	These do not work yet really, but I committed and changed primary
	parts of the them for testing and development.

Beta 0.2.1 Release
--------------------------------

--------------------------------
Beta 0.2.0 Release
--------------------------------

Fixes several bugs

- Error on new registration
- Editorial picks and ratings gets and shows the wrong records
- Avatars were blowing up when there were errors in the form
- Fixed bad listings when 'Latest Remixes' were visible

Most new 'features' were actually for enabling ccMixter specific scenarios between 
international Creative Commons installations, hence the 0.2 bump. As of today the 
RESTful sample pool API in this release is considered 'undocumented' and therefore 
should be ignored by non-Creative Commons clients until further notice (i.e. 
after it works).

--------------------------------
Beta 0.1.1 Release
--------------------------------

The update fixes several problems with the initial release:

- Bad paths being generated for contests and media pages (especially when not using mod_rewrite)
- NonCommercial license was pointing to the wrong image file
- System was demanding a cookie domain for several installations 'null' was the right choice
- Added API for developers to check for and add permanant menu items on the fly
- Checking for writable phptal_cache directory when template generation fails

Patches for 0.1.0 installation are included in this release in ccextras/cc-update.php
which will be picked up the first time you run the new installation.
