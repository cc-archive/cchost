<div class="pullquote" style="margin-left: 0;"><h1>Cibelle</h1>"The whole process of making music has changed. The very concept of composition now extends to the creation of sounds and textures. I'm very curious to see how other people will use and manipulate my sounds and how they will use them as tools to create new music." <br/>&mdash; <strong>Cibelle</strong> </div>
<div class="pullquote"><h1>Apollo Nove</h1>"I like the idea of giving people the opportunity to hear what I hear when I'm producing &mdash; a separate candombl&eacute; percussion track or some painstakingly constructed soundscape. If mixing is part of the compositional process, it's only natural that I try sharing the compositional responsibilities with anyone interested in taking them on." <br/>&mdash; <strong>Apollo Nove</strong></div>
<div class="pullquote" style="margin-right: 0; padding-right:0;"><h1>DJ Dolores</h1>"This is what every intelligent musician should do. The idea is to share and allow one's work to be cut up, reinvented and &mdash; who knows &mdash; transformed into something even better than the original. This isn't about generosity; it's about inventing new ways of creating musical products that go well beyond the world of physical carriers like vinyl and CDs." <br/>&mdash; <strong>DJ Dolores</strong></div>
