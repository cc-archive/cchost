</p>
<h2 >About Tamy</h2>
<p > Tamy's music is Bossa Nova with a 21st Century twist. Hailing from Vitoria, 
Brazil, the singer/songwriter mixes MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira) with electronic beats, croons 
to the swing of Rio's famous samba-funk and sings softly alongside Afro-Brazilian grooves. Add to the 
mix her melodic vocal arrangements and a danceable beat and you have something everyone can appreciate.</p>

    Enzo Torregrossa AKA ZONE, is among the very best modern jazz players in the world. And, lucky for us, the Italian bass 
    player, who has performed alongside masters Dizzie Gillespie and Kenneth Jackson, is back in action. 
  </p>
<p > 
On MADRUGADA, ZONE explores his newly found identity on technology mixing it with trademark live arrangements, cleverly mounding contemporary jazz into dance culture. Breaking new grounds in modern Latin music via songs like PENSO EM MIM (feat. singer/songwriter - MANOLA MICALIZZI), ZONE places himself high next to the peers that inspired him in the first place.</p>
<p  style="clear:both"> "Zone has meticulously created an intriguing fusion of jazz and dance music to yield a unique melody the jazz scene hasnâ€™t yet tasted. The Italian bass player has made comrades of two very different genres of music, and collided what most would consider polar opposites to combine into musical eloquence. Zone will most notably be recognized for a risky marriage of two seemingly distant musical expressions and making one great sound."
