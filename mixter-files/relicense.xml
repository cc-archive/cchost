<h1>Relicensing</h1>
<div id="opener">
<h2>Welcome to the new and improved ccMixter.</h2>

<p>Before you jump into the new site we need to tell you that we are now using the Creative Commons <a href="">Attribution</a> and <a href="">Attribution NonCommercial</a> style licenses
as our defaults for uploads and we urge you to consider re-licensing your work with these licenses.</p>

<p><b>Why relicense your works?</b></p>

<p>The licenses we were using previously (the Sampling Plus and NonCommerical Sampling Plus variety) are very good
for keeping a tight reign on your material. This might be an approriate choice for well established artists who wish
to share music in the Commons, however most ccMixter users found the restrictiions <i>too</i> tight since it limited
the amount of exposure their music can get.</p>

<p><b>What do the new licenses offer the previous one did not?</b></p>

<ul id="whatsbetter">
<li>With the <b>Attribution</b> license film makers, both commercial and non-commercial can use your remix "as is"
without modification. In addition the material can be used in advertising which is typically great exposure for the
music. <i>Most importantly</i>: the <b>Attribution</b> license can "mix" with other Creative Commons licenses 
such a those used by most CC-friendly labels and other web site while the Sampling licensed music can not.</li>

<li>The <b>Attribution NonCommercial</b> license has all of the same features as the Attribution license with the additional
restriction that your music can not be used in a commercial setting. That means that non commercial video bloggers
and flash animators can use your music as long as they give you credit.</li>
</ul>

<p>The screen below was designed to guide you through the process of re-licensing as quickly and painlessly as possible
so you can go on to use the other new features of the site.</p>

<tal:block condition="relicense_info/originals | relicense_info/cleared" on-error="">
<p><b>Consider:</b> If you relicense your music to a less restrictive license (like Attribution and Attribution NonCommercial) then 
ccMixter policy is that you can not go back 
to the more restrictive one (like Sampling Plus and NonCommercial Sampling Plus).</p>

<p><b>Consider:</b> Remixers thinking about sampling your music will probably appreciate the less restrictive license.</p>

<p><b>Consider:</b> Relicensing now allows people that have already sampled your work to relicense. Otherwise
they are 'stuck' with the old, more restrictive version.</p>

<p>You can always relicense your work later from each upload's page.</p>
