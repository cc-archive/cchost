<h1>CCMIXTER PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of "personal information" 
by Creative Commons, a Massachusetts Corporation, with its principal place of business 
at 543 Howard Street, San Francisco, 94150, USA, and its agents of users and visitors to 
the website available at <A HREF="http://ccmixter.org">http://ccmixter.org</A> ("ccMixter"). As used 
in this policy, "personal 
information" means information that would allow a party to identify you, such as, for 
example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.
</p><p>
Personal information we collect: Through ccMixter, Creative Commons collects the 
personal information that you submit at the following pages: (a) the artist's profile page;
</p><p>
(b) discussion forums; and (c) the private contest entry page. You decide what and how 
much personal information we collect at these pages except that we require (through the 
<A HREF="/terms">ccMixter Terms</A>) that your contact information is accurate and up-to-date in 
case we need to contact you for reasons related to ccMixter, for example, you have won a 
competition or someone claims music you posted to ccMixter is infringing. It is your 
responsibility to check and correct this information. 
All of the information you submit at the artist's profile page (with the exception of your 
email address and password) and the discussion forums is made available at ccMixter to 
people who access ccMixter.
</p><p>
Creative Commons uses your email address and password solely for the purposes of: (a) 
administering ccMixter, so for example, to contact you about one of the tracks you 
uploaded or to send you a password reminder; and, (b) for the purpose of contacting you 
as part of a mass mailing about new features on the ccMixter site, upcoming contests and 
other things directly related to ccMixter. The first time we contact you as part of a mass 
mailing, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future similar emails 
from us. In no circumstances will Creative Commons sell your personal information or 
aggregated information that may reflect your usage of ccMixter.
</p><p>
The information submitted at the private contest entry page is retained by us and used 
solely for the purpose of conducting the private contest in respect of which you submitted 
your personal information or in accordance with (b) above.
</p><p>
Creative Commons also collects personal information about you when you send us an 
email or other communication. Creative Commons uses any such personal information 
solely for the purpose of responding to and acting appropriately in response to your email 
or other communication.
</p><p>
Non-personal 'browsing' and ccMixter usage information that we collect: When you 
use ccMixter, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may 
collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your 
"IP address") about your activities while visiting the site, including the web pages you 
view and the times you view them and information about the browser you are using. We 
do not link browsing information to the personal information you submit to us; we use 
this browsing information for internal purposes such as to help understand how the site is 
being used and to improve it, and for systems administration purposes. An IP address is a 
number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In 
some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but 
if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from 
session to session.
</p><p>
Creative Commons also retains information about the usage of ccMixter, such as, for 
example, number of uploads, number of downloads, number of users. This information is 
aggregated information does not personally identify you. Creative Commons may make 
this aggregated information available to the public and other entities, such as our funders.
</p><p>
The disclosures we may make of personal information: In general, it is not Creative 
Commons' practice to disclose personal information to third parties. We may share 
personal information in two instances.
</p><p>
Firstly, Creative Commons may share personal information with our contractors and 
service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the site. In 
that case, Creative Commons requires those contractors and service providers to abide by 
this Privacy Policy and to only use any and all personal information solely for the 
purpose of performing their responsibilities for Creative Commons and then only to the 
extent necessary to perform those responsibilities.
</p><p>
Secondly, we may share personal information with third parties such as the government 
or other entities when required to by law, in order to comply with section 512(g) of the 
US Copyright Act (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/dmca">see...</a>), or as 
required by court order.
</p><p>
The security of personal information collected via ccMixter: Creative Commons has 
implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized 
access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. However, no 
Internet site can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may circumvent our security 
measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We 
will post a reasonably prominent notice to ccMixter if any such security breach occurs.
</p><p>
Questions? If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at 
info@creativecommons.org.
</p><p>
We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your personal information. Creative 
Commons may revise  this policy at any time by updating this posting and posting a 
notice in the discussion forum.
