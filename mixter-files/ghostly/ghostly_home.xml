<h2>About Christopher Willits</h2>

Christopher Willits is a musician and multimedia artist located in San Francisco, California. Striking a delicate balance between acoustic and electronic sounds and systems, Willits manages to defy genre distinctions while still defining a sound unto his own. His numerous solo releases cover a broad spectrum of musical styles, and include one main commonality: Willits' unique use of the guitar with custom-made signal processing. This home-brewed software, along with Willits’ 6-string prowess, generates a unique real-time mixture of improvised melody and rhythm. Guitar lines and harmonies fold into each other. Notes and phrases hook and weave, creating complex patterns of interlocking rhythm, melody, and texture. On his breakthrough LP, <a href="http://www.ghostly.com/1.0/ghostly/gi54.shtml">Surf Boundaries</a>, Willits merges the patterns of his signature guitar sound with treated strings, brass and five-part vocal harmonies for a sonic vision that draws upon elements of shoegaze, jazz, ambient and noise.  The San Francisco Weekly named Willits "the center cell of a rather complex indie rock-avant-garde electronic art Venn diagram." </p>
<p>Willits has a vast range of collaborations he is involved in, which include bands, sound installations, and film/video projects.  The <a href="http://www.ghostly.com/1.0/artists/nvso">North Valley Subconscious Orchestra</a> is the project of guitarists Brad Laner and Christopher Willits, traversing a series of guitar noise sculptures and heavily processed pop songs.</p>
