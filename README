1.   What's New
---------------------------------

Please read the document NEWS.


2.   System Requirements
---------------------------------

This system requires PHP 4, and prefers 4.3 but
has been seen working on 4.4 and 5

PHP 3 will never be supported

MySQL 4 is required.

COOKIES must be enabled in your browser in 
order to log in to a session

This system has been tested on Apache 1 and 2
Windows and Linux. If you've got it working on
IIS or OSX let us know. We haven't tried.

Install the GetID3 (1.7.3) library from here: 
http://www.getid3.org/#download
before you install ccHost. (It's a simple
download-unpack operation)

Ratings, Editorial Picks and Contest Polls
are built into the core ccHost, user reviews 
and comments are NOT and relies on phpBB2 forum 
software to achieve this.

If you would like integrated user comments
and review threads you must install phpBB2
from http://www.phpbb.com/downloads.php
(This is a little more complicated but still
managable.)

Aug. 28 2005: There have been some complaints 
about incompatibilities with the very
latest phpBB2, these have not been verified
but the 'workaround' seems to relatively
simple.
