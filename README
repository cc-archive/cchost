This package is an early-adopters ALPHA of ccHost version 5

As of this writing (Feb. 27, 2008) this is the code currently running
on ccMixter.org so it is known to work under SOME conditions. However 
it is NOT recommended to be used on a production/public site and 
this release is for testing and purposes only.

In this document:

1. NEW INSTALL
2. UPGRADE
3. IMPORTING phpTAL Templates
4. KNOWN ISSUES
5. DEVELOPERS
6. SECURITY ALERT



1. NEW INSTALL
----------------
1. Unzip the package on a local machine
2. Copy the directory structure to the root of your web server
3. Browse to http://your_domain/ccadmin


2. UPGRADE
------------
For upgrading from ccHost 4.x or before:

1. Do not try the upgrade on your main/production/public site.
2. Make a copy of your entire ccHost database onto your test site
3. Copy your content (e.g. 'people' directory) to your test site
4. Copy your cc-config-db.php to the root of your test site
5. Unzip the ccHost 5 package on a local machine
6. Copy the directory structure to your test site's server
7. Browse to http://your_domain/ccadmin

NOTE: It is recommended that you do NOT copy any plugins or
custom code that have not been ported to ccHost 5. (See Developers
section below)


3. IMPORTING phpTAL Templates
------------------------------

None of your version 4 skins, pages, etc. work anymore as is. You can 
try to import your old phpTAL XML templates using:

     bin/cc-host-import-v4-template.php 

Many imported templates (like your home page) might "just work" 
but many will need tweaking, assuming you are familiar with PHP.

4. KNOWN ISSUES
-----------------

The list of known issues is very dynamic and up to YOU to keep
up to date by checking and submitting bugs to our Source Forge
bug tracker:

Category: ccHost

5. DEVELOPERS
--------------

If you have written custom PHP code or plugins for ccHost v4 or before
you should first get the ccHost 5 installation up and running before
trying your custom code. Much has changed in the code and the chances
of your custom 'just working' is very low. The new core APIs are still
very fluid so expect more churn.

6. SECURITY ALERT
------------------

The new template engine uses a .tpl extension file that is generally
directly accessable from the web. If you don't map that extension to
some program (like php) in your server configuration then users will
see SQL syntax directly in their browsers.

1.   What's New
---------------------------------

Please read the document NEWS.


2.   System Requirements
---------------------------------

a.  APACHE.  This system has been tested on Apache 1 and 2 Windows and
Linux.  If you get it working on IIS or OSX let us know.  We haven't
tried.

b.  PHP.  This system requires PHP 4, and prefers 4.3 but has been seen
working on 4.4 and 5.  PHP 3 will never be supported.

c.  MYSQL.  MySQL 4 is required.

d.  GETID3.  Download the GetID3 (1.7.3 - 1.7.7 tested to work) library from
http://www.getid3.org/#download, then untar and place into ccHost at
cchost/getid3/. 

Ratings, Editorial Picks, Reviews, Comments and Contest Polls are built into 
the core ccHost. Support for phpBB2 is removed in this release, as ccHost
supports native forums.

e.  BROWSER.  Should work on any browser.  COOKIES must be enabled in
your browser in order to log in to a session.


3. New Installations/Upgrading from previous ccHost
------------------------------------------------------

To install follow the instructions in ccadmin/INSTALL.txt.


4. Known Issues
------------------------

- The 'Download Manager' is not supported in non-pretty urls mode 

- getID3 1.7.7 has a problem tagging RIFF files (WAV, AVI, etc.)
  The work around is to remove line 105 in getid3/write.php that
  looks like:
     case 'riff': // maybe not officially, but people do it anyway
