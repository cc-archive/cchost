The ccHost v5 package is an early-adopters ALPHA 

As of this writing (Feb. 27, 2008) this is the code currently running
on ccMixter.org so it is known to work under SOME conditions. However 
it is NOT recommended to be used on a production/public site and 
this release is for testing and bug finding/fixing purposes only.

8. HOWTO: CREATE A SKIN
9. HOWTO: REPAIR A CONFIG (A.K.A. HELP!!!!)


1. NEW INSTALL
----------------
1. Unzip the package on a local machine
2. Copy the directory structure to the root of your web server
3. Browse to http://your_domain


2. UPGRADE
------------
For upgrading from ccHost 4.x or before:

1. Do not try the upgrade on your main/production/public site.
2. Make a copy of your entire ccHost database onto your test site
3. Copy your content (e.g. 'people' directory) to your test site
4. Copy your cc-config-db.php to the root of your test site 
   (edit manually if you renamed the database or changed user information)
5. Unzip the ccHost 5 package on a local machine
6. Copy the directory structure to your test site's server (including ccadmin)
7. Browse to http://your_domain

NOTE: It is recommended that you do NOT copy any plugins or
custom code that have not been ported to ccHost 5. (See Developers
section below)


3. IMPORTING phpTAL TEMPLATES
------------------------------

None of your version 4 skins, pages, etc. work anymore as is. You can 
try to import your old phpTAL XML templates using:

     bin/cc-host-import-v4-template.php 

Many imported templates (like your home page) might "just work" 
but many will need tweaking, assuming you are familiar with PHP.

4. KNOWN ISSUES
-----------------

The list of known issues is very dynamic and up to YOU to keep
up to date by checking and submitting bugs to our Source Forge
bug tracker:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=559966&group_id=80503&func=browse

Category: ccHost

5. DEVELOPERS
--------------

If you have written custom PHP code or plugins for ccHost v4 or before
you should first get the ccHost 5 installation up and running before
trying your custom code. Much has changed in the code and the chances
of your custom 'just working' is very low. The new core APIs are still
very fluid so expect more churn.

6. SECURITY ALERT
------------------

The new template engine uses a .tpl extension file that is generally
directly accessable from the web. If you don't map that extension to
some program (like php) in your server configuration then users can
see SQL syntax directly in their browsers.

7. HOWTO: CONTENT MANAGER
--------------------------

In ccHost 5 you can create pages in your system without any HTML/XML file editing 
whatsoever. Examples of pages created this way are the ccMixter home page and
"As Seen on the Web"

http://ccmixter.org/
http://ccmixter.org/view/media/remix/trackback

The second example is mapped to a navigation tab. The creation of a page like this
and mapping to a tab are explained here:

First create new content topics:

1. While logged in as admin account: Click on 'Global Settings' in the menu
2. Click on 'Manage Page Content'
3. Click on 'Create New Content'
4. At 'New Content Type' type in "my_page_content" (without the quotes)
5. Enter a title and topic contents
6. Click on 'Submit Content'

Repeat these steps for addition topics except replace step (4):

4. At 'Content Type' select 'my_page_content' from the drop down, 
   leave 'New Content Type' blank

Images are uploaded to cchost_files/images (replace cchost_files with the name of the
files directory you supplied during install). To refer to those images use the new 'img' 
block in your topics. Example:

[img=/cchost_files/images/my_image.gif][/img]

You can also use the new 'left' or 'right' blocks to float images or blocks of text:

[left][img=/cchost_files/images/my_image.gif][/img][/left]

Next create a new content page:

1. While logged in as admin account: Click on 'Global Settings' in the menu
2. Click on 'Manage Page Content'
3. Click on 'Create a New Page'
4. At 'Content Type' select "my_page_content" 
5. Enter a page title like "My Page" (without the quotes)
6. Click on 'Submit' - this should take you back to the 'Manage Page Content' screen
7. Click on 'view' next to your new page to preview the page (Note the URL in your browser)

To map your new page to a tab:

1. While logged in as admin account: Click on 'Manage Site' in the menu
2. Click on 'Navigator Tab Sets'
3. Click on '[edit tabs]'
4. Click on 'Add tab'
5. Under 'Function' select 'Execute URL'
6. Under 'Data' enter the URL from Step (7) in the section above
7. Click on 'Submit'

HINT: entering a full URL in a tab causes a re-direct (extra round trip to your server). To 
prevent this in Step (6) enter "/viewfile/my-page" without the quotes and 
substituting my-page with the name of your page.


8. HOWTO: CREATE A SKIN
-----------------------

During the install/upgrade you were prompted for the name of where to keep your
local (non ccHost system) files. In the documenation below, substitute that
directory name in place of cchost_files.

1. While logged in as admin account: Click on 'Manage Site' in the menu
2. Click on 'Skin'
3. Click on 'Create Skin Template'
4. Type in a name like "my_skin" (without the quotes)
5. Click 'Create New Skin'

Over riding 'shared' styles and layouts:

Most of what you need should be in cchost_files/skins/my_skin directory. If you
want to modify a specific screen layout, style or javascript behavior other than 
the body or page template (like the upload listings) then COPY the file(s) from 
ccskins/shared/* into cchost_files/skins/my_skin and edit there. Your changes will 
be noted by ccHost and override the 'shared' version.


9. HOWTO: REPAIR A CONFIG (A.K.A. HELP!!!!)
--------------------------------------------

If you get into 'trouble' with your system you might be able to salvage your site
by browsing to either:

http://your_server/admin/edit
http://your_server?ccm=/media/admin/edit
http://your_server/cchost_lib/cc-config-repair.php

---------------------------------

a.  APACHE.  This system has been tested on Apache 1 and 2 Windows and
Linux.  If you get it working on IIS or OSX let us know.  We haven't
tried.

b.  PHP.  This system requires PHP 4, and prefers 4.3 but has been seen
working on 4.4 and 5.  PHP 3 will never be supported.

c.  MYSQL.  MySQL 4 is required.

d.  GETID3.  Download the GetID3 (1.7.3 - 1.7.7 tested to work) library from
http://www.getid3.org/#download, then untar and place into ccHost at
cchost/getid3/. 

Ratings, Editorial Picks, Reviews, Comments and Contest Polls are built into 
the core ccHost. Support for phpBB2 is removed in this release, as ccHost

your browser in order to log in to a session.


3. New Installations/Upgrading from previous ccHost

4. Known Issues
------------------------

- The 'Download Manager' is not supported in non-pretty urls mode 

- getID3 1.7.7 has a problem tagging RIFF files (WAV, AVI, etc.)
  The work around is to remove line 105 in getid3/write.php that
  looks like:
     case 'riff': // maybe not officially, but people do it anyway
