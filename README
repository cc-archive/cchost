1.   What's New
---------------------------------

Please read the document NEWS.


2.   System Requirements
---------------------------------

a.  APACHE.  This system has been tested on Apache 1 and 2 Windows and
Linux.  If you get it working on IIS or OSX let us know.  We haven't
tried.

b.  PHP.  This system requires PHP 4, and prefers 4.3 but has been seen
working on 4.4 and 5.  PHP 3 will never be supported.

c.  MYSQL.  MySQL 4 is required.

d.  GETID3.  Download the GetID3 (1.7.3 - 1.7.7 tested to work) library from
http://www.getid3.org/#download, then untar and place into ccHost at
cchost/getid3/. 

Ratings, Editorial Picks, Reviews, Comments and Contest Polls are built into 
the core ccHost. Support for phpBB2 is removed in this release, as ccHost
supports native forums.

e.  BROWSER.  Should work on any browser.  COOKIES must be enabled in
your browser in order to log in to a session.


3. New Installations/Upgrading from previous ccHost
------------------------------------------------------

To install follow the instructions in ccadmin/INSTALL.txt.


4. Known Issues
------------------------

- The 'Download Manager' is not supported in non-pretty urls mode 

- getID3 1.7.7 has a problem tagging RIFF files (WAV, AVI, etc.)
  The work around is to remove line 105 in getid3/write.php that
  looks like:
     case 'riff': // maybe not officially, but people do it anyway
